	<h1><i>Fujimoto</i></h1>
	<p><i>History</i><br>
	Tatsuki Fujimoto was born on October 10 in Nikaho, Japan. Fujimoto has said his influences were Korean Films,
	he explains in the terms of the 2008 fil <i>The Chaser</i>. He explains its not like your typical film, its different
	and always keep you on your toes! From a young age he partook in oil painting classes in his home time and had always 
	aspired to be a manga artist, he also studied Western Painting at college.
	
	<br>Fujimoto has never been an assistant artist, he has been posting one-shot mangas since 2013 with his first release 
	named <i>Love is Blind</i> which he won an honourable mention at the Shueisha Crown Newcomer's Award. He first gained 
	popular traction was his manga series <i>Fire Punch</i> which ran for eight volumes in 2016. His first major hit was 
	<i>Chainsaw Man</i> which has been running since 2018!

	<br>Fujimoto has a very small online presence, one of the only known videos of him is trying to levitate?
	It does match the wacky and weird world of his work though!
	
	<br>
	<br><i>Past Works</i><br>
	Many of Fujimoto's early works are one-shots, these are short stories. These include but 
	are not limited to;
		<br>○Look Back, soon to be adapted into a feature length film
		<br>○Goodbye Eri
		<br>○Before Chainsaw Man 17-21
		<br>○Before Chainsaw Man 22-26
			<br>○These two books have been officially published now and contain alot
			Fujimoto's earliest work to bring the deserved attention<br>
		
	<br><i>Logo</i><br>
	<br>Due to Fujimoto's lack of internet presense, he usually goes under the alias of a mascot.
	The mascot is a heart with human like features such as arms, legs and a face.
